  ├── shared/        # Shared components and utilities
  └── config/        # Configuration files
```

#### File Naming Conventions
Establish and follow consistent naming patterns:
```markdown
feature-name/
  ├── feature-name.component.ts
  ├── feature-name.service.ts
  ├── feature-name.model.ts
  └── feature-name.utils.ts
```

#### Code Organization Principles
Structure your code with clear separation of concerns:
- Group related functionality together
- Maintain consistent import patterns
- Use clear module boundaries
- Follow established architectural patterns

### Documenting Architectural Decisions

Recording architectural decisions helps Cursor AI understand the reasoning behind your code structure. Create and maintain an Architecture Decision Record (ADR):

#### ADR Template
```markdown
# Architecture Decision Record (ADR)

## Decision Title
[Brief description of the decision]

## Context
[What is the issue that we're seeing that is motivating this decision or change?]

## Decision
[What is the change that we're proposing and/or doing?]

## Consequences
[What becomes easier or more difficult to do because of this change?]
```

   ```

3. **Scope Definition**
   ```markdown
   @codebase --scope "feature-name/*" "Focus on specific feature"
   ```

#### Context Preservation
Maintain context across sessions:

1. Create a `.cursorrc` configuration file:
   ```json
   {
     "contextPersistence": true,
     "excludePatterns": ["node_modules", "dist"],
     "includePatterns": ["src/**/*"],
     "scanDepth": 3
   }
   ```

2. Document key context points:
   ```markdown
   # Context Notes

## 🎯 Mastering Efficient Prompting in Cursor AI

Understanding how to craft effective prompts is essential for getting the most out of Cursor AI. Think of prompting as having a conversation with a highly skilled developer who needs clear context and direction to help you effectively. Let's explore how to master this crucial skill.

### Understanding Prompt Architecture

When crafting prompts for Cursor AI, consider the prompt as having three key components: context, instruction, and expected outcome. This structure helps the AI understand exactly what you need and how to deliver it.

For example, instead of writing:
```markdown
"Make an authentication system"
```

Write:
```markdown
"Create an authentication system using JWT tokens for a React application, following MVVM architecture. The system should handle user registration, login, and password reset functionality. Please include error handling and input validation."
```

### Architectural Requirements in Prompts

When specifying architecture requirements, be explicit about patterns and structures you want to follow. Consider this progression of prompts from basic to comprehensive:

Basic prompt:
```markdown
"Create a user service"
```

Improved prompt:
```markdown
"Create a user service following MVVM architecture with:
- Core service layer for business logic
- Data models in separate files
- Repository pattern for data access
- Dependency injection for service composition
Please maintain separation of concerns and include error handling."
```

### Documentation Integration

Requesting documentation alongside code generation helps maintain project clarity and facilitates team collaboration. Here's how to effectively request documentation:

```markdown
@swiftUI "Create a custom button component with:
- Parameter documentation
- Usage examples
- Edge case handling
- Accessibility considerations
Please include inline comments explaining key decisions."
```

### Complex Feature Development

When working with complex features, break down your prompts into logical steps and provide clear examples. Here's an effective approach:

```markdown
"I need to implement a real-time chat feature. Let's break this down:

1. First, show me the data model for messages and conversations:
   Example message structure:
   {
     id: string,
     content: string,
     timestamp: Date,
     sender: User
   }

2. Then create the service layer with WebSocket handling
3. Finally, implement the UI components following Material Design"
```

### Context-Aware Prompting

Learn to provide appropriate context for different situations:

For new features:
```markdown
@codebase "We're adding a new payment processing feature. The existing codebase uses Stripe for payments and Redux for state management. Generate a payment service that:
1. Integrates with our existing Stripe implementation
2. Follows our Redux patterns
3. Implements error handling consistent with our current approach"
```

For modifications:
```markdown
@codebase "In the user-profile.service.ts file, we need to add profile picture upload functionality. Consider our existing AWS S3 integration and maintain our current error handling patterns."
```

### Common Prompting Patterns

Here are some effective patterns for common development scenarios:

#### 1. Feature Implementation
```markdown
"Implement [feature name] with these requirements:
- Business logic: [specific requirements]
- Technical constraints: [list constraints]
- Integration points: [existing systems]
- Error scenarios: [what to handle]"
```

#### 2. Code Refactoring
```markdown
"Refactor the following code to:
- Improve performance by [specific goal]
- Follow [specific pattern]
- Maintain existing functionality
- Include unit tests"
```

#### 3. Bug Fixing
```markdown
"Debug the following issue:
- Current behavior: [description]
- Expected behavior: [description]
- Error logs: [if available]
- Related components: [list components]"
```

### Tips for Prompt Refinement

To get better results from Cursor AI, consider these advanced prompting techniques:

1. **Be Specific About Output Format**
   ```markdown
   "Generate TypeScript interfaces for our data models with:
   - JSDoc comments
   - Type guards
   - Validation methods"
   ```

2. **Include Success Criteria**
   ```markdown
   "Create API endpoints that:
   - Handle rate limiting
   - Include request validation
   - Return standardized responses
   Success means: All endpoints have tests, documentation, and error handling"
   ```

3. **Reference Existing Patterns**
   ```markdown
   "Following the pattern in user.service.ts, create a similar service for product management"
   ```

### Troubleshooting Prompts

When you're not getting the desired results, try these refinement strategies:

1. **Add More Context**
   Before: "Fix the authentication"
   After: "Fix the JWT token refresh mechanism in the authentication service, considering our current token expiration of 1 hour"

2. **Specify Constraints**
   Before: "Make it perform better"
   After: "Optimize the product search function to return results in under 200ms by implementing caching and pagination"

3. **Clarify Expectations**
   Before: "Add tests"
   After: "Add unit tests covering success cases, error handling, and edge cases, maintaining our current Jest testing patterns"

### Measuring Prompt Effectiveness

Monitor these aspects to improve your prompting skills:

1. **Response Relevance**
   - Does the generated code match your requirements?
   - Are architectural patterns followed correctly?
   - Is the documentation comprehensive?

2. **Iteration Efficiency**
   - How many prompt refinements were needed?
   - Was the initial response useful?
   - Did the context help or hinder?

---

*💡 Pro Tip: Keep a prompting journal where you document particularly effective prompts for different scenarios. This creates a valuable reference for your team and helps establish consistent prompting patterns across your project.*


## 🛡️ Quality Assurance for AI-Generated Code

Quality assurance takes on special importance when working with AI-generated code. While Cursor AI produces high-quality code, proper QA processes ensure that the output meets all requirements and maintains high standards. Let's explore how to implement a robust QA process for AI-generated code.

### Understanding AI Code Review

Reviewing AI-generated code requires a different approach than reviewing human-written code. The AI might sometimes make assumptions or implement patterns that need careful validation. Here's how to approach this effectively:

When reviewing AI-generated code, first understand the context in which it was generated. The AI works based on the prompts and context provided, so begin by asking:

"Does this code solve the problem as specified in our requirements?"
"Are there any assumptions made that might not align with our project needs?"
"How does this code integrate with our existing systems?"

### Systematic Code Review Process

Let's break down the code review process into manageable steps:

1. **Initial Code Assessment**
Begin with a high-level review of the generated code:
```typescript
// Example AI-generated authentication service
class AuthService {
  constructor(private userRepo: UserRepository) {}
  
  async login(credentials: LoginDTO) {
    // REVIEW: Verify error handling matches our patterns
    // REVIEW: Check password hashing implementation
    // REVIEW: Validate token generation approach
  }
}
```

Look for:
- Architecture alignment
- Security considerations
- Performance implications
- Code organization
- Naming conventions

2. **Detailed Technical Review**
Examine specific technical aspects:

```typescript
async function processUserData(userData: UserDTO) {
  // REVIEW: Check input validation
  try {
    // REVIEW: Verify transaction handling
    // REVIEW: Confirm error propagation
  } catch (error) {
    // REVIEW: Validate error handling pattern
  }
}
```

Focus on:
- Input validation
- Error handling
- Transaction management
- Resource cleanup
- Memory management

### Edge Case Testing Strategy

Edge case testing requires systematic thinking about potential failure points. Let's explore a structured approach:

1. **Input Boundaries**
Test the limits of input parameters:
```typescript
describe('User Registration', () => {
  it('handles empty email', async () => {
    // Test empty email scenarios
  });
  
  it('handles maximum length inputs', async () => {
    // Test maximum length scenarios
  });
  
  it('handles special characters', async () => {
    // Test special character scenarios
  });
});
```

2. **State Transitions**
Verify behavior during state changes:
```typescript
describe('Authentication Flow', () => {
  it('handles token expiration during operation', async () => {
    // Test token expiration scenarios
  });
  
  it('manages concurrent login attempts', async () => {
    // Test concurrent access scenarios
  });
});
```

3. **Resource Management**
Test resource allocation and cleanup:
```typescript
describe('File Upload Service', () => {
  it('handles interrupted uploads', async () => {
    // Test incomplete upload scenarios
  });
  
  it('manages multiple simultaneous uploads', async () => {
    // Test concurrent upload scenarios
  });
});
```

### Coding Standards Compliance

Ensuring AI-generated code follows your team's standards involves several aspects:

1. **Style Guide Conformance**
Create a checklist for style verification:
```typescript
// Style Guide Checklist
// ✓ Proper indentation
// ✓ Consistent naming conventions
// ✓ Comment formatting
// ✓ File organization
// ✓ Import ordering
```

2. **Architecture Patterns**
Verify adherence to architectural principles:
```typescript
// Architecture Checklist
// ✓ Dependency injection usage
// ✓ Service layer separation
// ✓ Data access patterns
// ✓ Error handling approaches
```

3. **Documentation Requirements**
Ensure proper documentation:
```typescript
/**
 * @description User authentication service
 * @param {UserRepository} userRepo - Repository for user operations
 * @throws {AuthenticationError} When credentials are invalid
 * @returns {Promise<AuthResult>} Authentication result with token
 */
```

### Automated Quality Checks

Implement automated checks for AI-generated code:

1. **Static Analysis**
Configure linters and static analyzers:
```json
{
  "eslintConfig": {
    "rules": {
      "complexity": ["error", { "max": 10 }],
      "max-lines": ["error", { "max": 300 }],
      "no-unused-vars": "error"
    }
  }
}
```

2. **Test Coverage**
Set up coverage requirements:
```json
{
  "jest": {
    "coverageThreshold": {
      "global": {
        "branches": 80,
        "functions": 80,
        "lines": 85
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Integration Testing

Verify how AI-generated code integrates with existing systems:

1. **Integration Test Scenarios**
```typescript
describe('System Integration', () => {
  it('integrates with existing authentication flow', async () => {
    // Test authentication integration
  });
  
  it('works with current database transactions', async () => {
    // Test database integration
  });
});
```

### Performance Validation

Assess performance implications:

1. **Performance Metrics**
```typescript
describe('Performance Tests', () => {
  it('meets response time requirements', async () => {
    const startTime = performance.now();
    // Execute operation
    const endTime = performance.now();
    expect(endTime - startTime).toBeLessThan(200); // 200ms threshold
  });
});
```

### Security Assessment

Implement security checks for AI-generated code:

1. **Security Checklist**
```markdown
- Input validation and sanitization
- Authentication and authorization
- Data encryption
- Session management
- Secure communication
```

### Documentation Review

Ensure comprehensive documentation:

1. **Documentation Requirements**
```markdown
- API documentation
